## Week 2

Hey everyone!

This week is going to (hopefully) be an exciting one. Data visualisation is an essential part of scientific computing, and that is our main focus for the week. We will be using matplotlib to create some exciting and dynamic plots - a sine wave evolving with time, plotting points one at a time to see graphs of functions being formed dynamically and the final aim of the week is to recreate Conway's Game of Life.

Conway's game of life is an example of cellular automaton. A cellular automaton is a collection of "coloured" cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring cells. The rules are then applied iteratively for as many time steps as desired.It is a mechanism for modelling systems with local interactions. A cellular automaton is a regular lattice of cells with local state, which interact with their neighbours subject to a uniform rule which governs all cells. The game of life is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

If you want to read more about it, the video and Wikipedia link given below might be a good place to start.

For today, please go through the matplotlib videos so that you are comfortable with this package. I have also included the video for the animation of a simple line graph which you may try out.
