Here is the third assignment. 

The first question is a warm-up to using odeint to solve a simple differential equation.

In the second question, you'll be modelling a zombie apocalypse - this is quite similar to the SIR model of infectious diseases.

In the third question, you'll solve a second-order differential equation for a spring-mass system using a simple method often used to solve higher-order differential equations. Do take note of this method as it may be useful later on. This is also your first physics problem in this course - so have fun!
