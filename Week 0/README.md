## Week 0

### Module 0.1

The first week is an introduction to python, for those who may not have used it/ are not yet comfortable for the platform. If you are using python for the first time, I'd urge you to download [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) - and use Jupiter notebooks as they are very user friendly and intuitive. The preferred way to use Python is via Jupyter, which can be launched from within the Anaconda navigator. There is NO assignment this week. If you are proficient in python, the course essentially starts from next week.

The content of this week focuses on introducing Python syntax and the coding environment in Jupyter. This is aimed mainly at those who are not familiar with Python and are using it for the first time. The main course content will start from next week onwards.

Here is an introduction on how to use Jupyter notebooks:

A good place to start with Python coding, is the micro-course on Python, available on Kaggle. It provides tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and hands-on coding experience in the form of Kaggle kernels, which are modelled as Jupyter notebooks too. Here is the link:

### Module 0.2

Once you are done with the above, here are some more resources for you to get hands-on practice with coding in Python. This material was created by Krittika: The Astronomy Club of IIT Bombay. It is present on github, in the form of multiple tutorials, each containing unsolved and solved versions of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), explaining the relevant Python concepts. The data used in these notebooks is mainly, publicly available astronomical data.

You can directly open these files from within Jupyter on your laptop, and work in them. Here are the instructions:

1. Open the link: https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials
2. All the files should be visible under the section "DEVANSH-DVJ" on this page. You are encouraged to view the "How to use Jupyter notebooks" and the "Jupyter Setup" files, by directly clicking on them. 
3. In order to download all the tutorial files, click on the green "Clone" button at the top right corner of this section, then select the "Download ZIP" option.
4. Unzip the "tutorials-master" folder that is downloaded, and save it at whatever location is convenient (preferably the Downloads folder itself).
5. Launch Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator, which will open its home page in a web browser.
6. On the home page, navigate to the location of the tutorials master folder and open the unsolved tutorial 1 file (eg. Downloads > tutorials-master > Tutorial_01 > Intro_to_Python.ipynb).
7. Once you've tried the tutorial on your own, you can open the solved tutorial 1 file to review your answers (eg. Downloads > tutorials-master > Tutorial_01 > Intro_to_Python-Solved.ipynb).
8. Similarly, you can open the unsolved and solved notebooks for all the tutorials.

Note that for the purposes of this course, only the following tutorials are relevant: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11 and 14. 
However, if you're already familiar with Python and want to explore further stuff that can be done with it, feel free to have a look at the other tutorials too.

Also note that all these tutorials are for practice only, aimed at helping you understand the main course content and complete the assignments that will begin from next week. It is okay if you do not understand all the stuff from all these tutorials completely.

### Module 0.3

By now, all of you must have had a decent exposure to basic programming in Python. You have seen how using different Python libraries with pre-defined data structures and functions can considerably simplify your task.

Now we are sharing some YouTube videos, which you can use to clarify your doubts that you might have in certain specific aspects of coding in Python.

This is the link to a YouTube playlist that explains one specific Python concept in each video, with great depth and detail, and in a great interactive fashion:

The relevant videos are titled "Python Tutorial for Beginners", and are indexed from 1 to 77. 
(Note that these videos do not use Jupyter notebooks for execution and compilation. The programs are simply written in Notepad, or Sublime Text Editor, and executed from the Python Shell)

This is the link to another comprehensive video, that introduces the concept of Scientific Computation using Python:

Note that this is quite a long video and explains a lot of stuff, all of which is not required as such, for basic scientific computation. You can watch this video as per your interest and use it as a reference for later tutorials.

With this, we have reached the end of week 0. From next week onwards, we'll begin with Scientific Computational methods and algorithms, and also include weekly assignments, which are to be submitted for grading purposes.
