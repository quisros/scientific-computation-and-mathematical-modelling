## Week 5

Welcome to the final week of this course on Scientific Computation and Mathematical Modelling. This week, we will walk you through the Runge-Kutta Algorithm, scipy modules to solve ODEs, oscillating systems such as the simple pendulum and the renowned Kepler Problem. Letâ€™s get started!

Explicit and implicit methods are approaches used in numerical analysis for obtaining numerical approximations to the solutions of time-dependent ordinary and partial differential equations, as is required in computer simulations of physical processes. Explicit methods calculate the state of a system at a later time from the state of the system at the current time, while implicit methods find a solution by solving an equation involving both the current state and the later one. 

The Runge-Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the well-known routine called the Euler Method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations.

For a discussion on the theory behind finding a more accurate, nonlinear integrator using the Taylor Series expansion and explanation of the Runge-Kutta 4th order integrator, refer to the following video:
